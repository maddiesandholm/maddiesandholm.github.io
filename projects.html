                            <p>This documentary covers the issue of the lack of diversity in newsrooms, focusing on the Fordham Lincoln Center’s student newspaper, <i>The Observer</i>,
                                and features some of the paper’s editors. Diversity of race/ethnicity, gender identity/sexual orientation, socioeconomic background, etc.,
                                are all important facets to consider when looking at any workplace, but the diversity of thought that they bring to a newsroom is mandatory 
                                for thorough coverage of any community. The Observer has made strides in the last few years to increase the diversity of its editors and contributors, 
                                but, as many of the interviewees mentioned, the newspaper has a long way to go. <br> <br>

                                Shaily Jani and I worked together to plan and shoot this documentary for our Digital Production for New Media course, and I edited the version embedded above. 
                                Our planning stage included reaching out to potential interviewees, scheduling times and writing the interview questions. We filmed most of the interviews 
                                in <i>The Observer’s</i> office and B-roll in the office or during the newspaper’s weekly workshops and biweekly productions. Post-production work took place in 
                                Adobe Premiere Pro and Audition, and I edited over 90 minutes of footage down to about five minutes of documentary, using clips from seven of the 12 interviews we conducted.

                            For this issue, I created the style guide, templates and all the spreads and graphics using Adobe InDesign, Illustrator and Photoshop.
                            My goal was to design an issue that has a unique visual language, has an eye-catching front page and is a fun (but not distracting) vessel for all the content about New York City.
